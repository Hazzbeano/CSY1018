    </ul>
<p>Starting salaries for Software developers ranges from a reasonable amount, to a fairly large amount. 
    This is dependent on the background of knowledge that is required e.g. python, SQL etc.. 
    Most employers are looking for employees who work well in teams. Every position that has been found,
     which fall within the salary scale, require a degree to even be considered for a position. </p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>
                    Within Games Development a common expectation of employees is a strong familiarity with 
                    Unity or Unreal studio, along with a capability to work efficiently and collaboratively
                    in a team on a tight schedule. 
            </p>

            <p>

                    Starting salaries tend to be high, rarely being any lower than £40,000 per year and very
                     few specifically ask for degree graduates.
            </p>

            <p>


                    Most jobs ask for high experience in C# / C++ programming languages (Occasionally JavaScript/Python)
                    and a good understanding of server/client communication and the ability to design and plan solutions.
            </p>

            <p>


                    For certain jobs they may ask for experience in VR programming and 2D/3D animation.
