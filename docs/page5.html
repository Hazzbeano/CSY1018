Models of Good Practice

        Design Choices  
    </div>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>When designing the website. I was mindful my choices to ensure that the finished product 
        would be pleasing overall. </p>

    <p>The material.io website was used a lot, to keep closely to the material guidelines recommended
        by google. The colour palette was one of the most useful tools that was used during the creation
        of my site. It gives a set theme of colours which can be used for an overall theme. I picked the 
        blue grey palette and set several different colours for headers, titles and footers. I took extra
        care to ensure that this was consistently implemented across all 6 of the webpages. </p>

    <p>
            Responsive design was used to ensure that the website would scale well across a multitude of 
            different devices. Media queries were used on some pages. Others had percentages for set widths, 
            instead of static pixel amounts. This means that the finished product now works really well with 
            mobile, tablet and PC.
    </p>

    <p>
            Static navigation and footers were implemented onto all webpages. This means that there isnâ€™t a
            different experience to each webpage, they all operate identically and are familiar to the end user. 
            The user can clearly see the webpage that they are currently on, and swap to the next one at a moments 
            notice should they need to. The footer is always one scroll away, allowing for easy access to contact
            information and social media. 
    </p>
