    <p>The experience of building this website has been an absolute nightmare, however it has been
        very rewarding also. I feel like I have learned a lot of web knowledge since beginning this
        project in 2017. If I were to go back and start it from scratch again, I feel that I would 
        be able to build a 2.0 version which would be leagues ahead of this current design. There 
        are many things that I would do differently to improve.  </p>

    <p>
            On reflection, I think that the website overall has been a success. It has met most of 
            the given criteria, if not all. It has been put together and it not too bad to use overall 
            in my opinion. During some points in the term, I did not feel that I would be able to get 
            a working website finished and submitted on time. I am glad now that the project is 
            complete, I feel a lot more prepared now for any other web projects. I would not say 
            that the first website I have EVER created has been a failure in any way at all! I am 
            happy that I have been able to overcome the obstacles in my way and get the page completed.
